Experimental branch:

  * Update Browser to parse each files whenever one is found.
  * Rewrite Parser from scratch (eg: tokenize whilst reading the file).
  * Use a bunch of objects to describe the tokenized source code
    instead of using a stupid array (eg. Php_Klass, Php_Function, etc).
  * Update Generator to use objects.
  
  * TextParser:
    * Use *bold* to mark <b>bold</b>
    * Use _emphase_ to mark <em>emphase</em>
    * Use +$attr+ to mark <code>$attr</code>
    * Use <tt>method</tt> to create links to classes, methods or functions.

Things to do:

  * Extract value of class attributes.
  * Extract source of functions and class methods.

  * Generate inheritence tree (ascending & descending) for a given class.
  * Document the inheritence tree.

  * Parse TODO:, NOTE:, CHANGED: and other kinds of DEPRECATED: contents in descriptions.
  * Document TODO:, DEPRECATED:, etc.
  * Generate special pages for parsed TODO:, DEPRECATED:, etc.

  * Detect constructors and destructors, and document them specifically.
