Things to do:

  * Parse class' attributes;
  * Generate documentation for class' attributes.
  
  * Use the markdown syntax to parse descriptions, TODO, etc.
  
  * Display the navbar on index page, as well as the README file (instead of list of classes).
  * Display classes/functions as a tree in navbar (using package & subpackage).
  
  * Create inheritence trees (ascending & descending) for a given class.
  * Return the list of methods inherited by a given class.
  * Display the above lists in generated documentation (ie: class X inheritates the following public methods).

  * Parse TODO, NOTE, CHANGED and other kinds of DEPRECATED contents in descriptions.
  * Display above contents (TODO, DEPRECATED, etc.) in pages
  * Generate special pages for parsed TODO, DEPRECATED, etc.

Bugs to fix:

  * Fix the bug that exploses <code> in comments (use of a markdown parser shall fix it).
